# Pen and Paper SpaceshipBattleGame

I wrote this little "game" for my own Pen &amp; Paper adventure in which the crew had to fight an enemy spaceship.

## Getting Started

1. Run the game using either:
   - The provided JAR file
   - Compile and run `Pen_and_Paper_SpaceshipBattleGame.java`
2. Select the number of players
3. For each player:
   - Choose a ship class
   - Name your ship
   - Select your team

## Gameplay

Each turn, players can choose from four actions:
- 🎯 Attack an enemy ship
- 🛡️ Recharge shields
- 🚀 Increase speed
- 🎲 Improve targeting accuracy

All stats affect both damage output and hit probability. Keep track of your ship's status using pen and paper to plan your strategy effectively.
