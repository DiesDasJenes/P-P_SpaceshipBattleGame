# Pen and Paper SpaceshipBattleGame

I wrote this little "game" for my own Pen &amp; Paper adventure in which the crew had to fight an enemy spaceship.

## Usage 

Initialize the jar or the java class FightSimulation.java and then choose the count of players.
After this every player gets to choose his class of ship, shipName and team. 

## How the game is played

Everyone needs pen and paper to write the stats of his or other ships down. The player needs to remember and think of an strategy to fight the enemy. He has 4 options: shoot at a ship, recharge shields, gain speed or recalculate the targeting accuracy. 

Every stats changes the taken damage and possibilty of an hit.
